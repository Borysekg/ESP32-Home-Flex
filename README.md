ESP32 Home Flex
ESP32 Home Flex is a customizable home automation solution based on the ESP32 microcontroller. It allows you to easily expand the capabilities of the base module with additional modules that can be connected via a custom 16-pin connector. The system is designed to be both DIY-friendly, allowing you to create your own modules and add them to the system, or to use pre-made modules that come in 3D printed cases.

Getting Started
To get started with ESP32 Home Flex, you will need:

The main ESP32 module
Additional modules that can be connected to the main module via the custom 16-pin connector
A power supply (12V DC) for the main module
Custom 16-Pin Connector
The custom 16-pin connector is used to connect the main module to additional modules. It provides the following pins:

Pin 1: Ground
Pin 2: +12V DC
Pin 3: +5V DC
Pin 4: GPIO32
Pin 5: GPIO33
Pin 6: GPIO25
Pin 7: GPIO26
Pin 8: GPIO27
Pin 9: GPIO14
Pin 10: GPIO12
Pin 11: GPIO13
Pin 12: GPIO15
Pin 13: GPIO2 (UART RX)
Pin 14: GPIO4 (SPI CS0)
Pin 15: GPIO5 (SPI CS1)
Pin 16: Ground
Using ESP32 Home Flex
To use ESP32 Home Flex, you can either create your own modules or use pre-made modules that are available for purchase. Pre-made modules come in 3D printed cases and can be easily connected to the main module via the custom 16-pin connector.

To program the main module and additional modules, you can use the Arduino IDE or other compatible software. The ESP32 Home Flex library provides easy-to-use functions for interacting with the custom 16-pin connector and the various pins on the ESP32.
